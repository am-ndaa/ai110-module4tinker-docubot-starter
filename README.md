# Summary

The core concept students need to understand is how RAG systems are implemented and why they are used. I think students might struggle with the setup. Installing the requirements might be tricky if they are running it from the wrong directry and don't realize. Also, generating the API key may be confusing if they have never worked with APIs before. Copilot was very helpful for this lab and it didn't mislead me anywhere. One way I would help a student without giving the answer is if they are confused on what the functions we implemented are doing. I would ask the student what their current understanding is or ask them to recap what they have completed so far so I can understand where they're at. 

# DocuBot

DocuBot is a small documentation assistant that helps answer developer questions about a codebase.  
It can operate in three different modes:

1. **Naive LLM mode**  
   Sends the entire documentation corpus to a Gemini model and asks it to answer the question.

2. **Retrieval only mode**  
   Uses a simple indexing and scoring system to retrieve relevant snippets without calling an LLM.

3. **RAG mode (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
   Retrieves relevant snippets, then asks Gemini to answer using only those snippets.

The docs folder contains realistic developer documents (API reference, authentication notes, database notes), but these files are **just text**. They support retrieval experiments and do not require students to set up any backend systems.

## Setup

### 1. Install Python dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the example file:

    cp .env.example .env

Then edit `.env` to include your Gemini API key:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

If you do not set a Gemini key, you can still run retrieval only mode.

---

## Running DocuBot

Start the program:

    python main.py

Choose a mode:

- **1**: Naive LLM (Gemini reads the full docs)  
- **2**: Retrieval only (no LLM)  
- **3**: RAG (retrieval + Gemini)

You can use built in sample queries or type your own.

---

## Running Retrieval Evaluation (optional)

    python evaluation.py

This prints simple retrieval hit rates for sample queries.

---

## Modifying the Project

You will primarily work in:

- `docubot.py`  
  Implement or improve the retrieval index, scoring, and snippet selection.

- `llm_client.py`  
  Adjust the prompts and behavior of LLM responses.

- `dataset.py`  
  Add or change sample queries for testing.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- A Gemini API key for LLM features (only needed for modes 1 and 3)
- No database, no server setup, no external services besides LLM calls
